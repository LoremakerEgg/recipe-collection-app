Short description of your project.

Our project is that of an inspirational recipe application, where the user has the ability to choose from a myriad of different options depending on their mood, from random recipes just to spark the imagination, to recipes that take under thirty minutes to prepare or recipes that include certain ingredients the user might be craving or that they already have at home. These recommended dishes will be displayed as small cards on the first page of the application, containing the name of the dish, the amount of time it takes to cook, an image of the dish and buttons for future use. The user can then click each card and get a full recipe with ingredients and instructions to follow on how to make the dish. On the initial page, the user also has the ability to sort through how many results they would like to have displayed on their screen, from 3, 6 and 9 stylized options.
Short description of your users
Our platform is designed to help people who are seeking cooking inspiration and assistance with meal planning, regardless of their technical knowledge. We understand that not everyone is tech-savvy, which is why our interface is simple and user-friendly.
What kind of problem does the product/service solve, or what value does it add
While there are numerous recipe websites that offer search functionality for specific dishes, it can be challenging to find inspiration for cooking when you don't have a particular recipe in mind. We aim to address this issue by providing a convenient way to discover new recipes through easily customizable filters that allow you to specify the general type of dishes you are interested in.
What techniques have been used
Prisma, NEXT.js, API fetches, server dev, advanced JavaScript, SCSS, UX design, git/GitHub, React, SQL
What project methodology did you use during the project
Agile methodology was used, where we began by setting our mission, purpose and “definition of done” for the project. We divided the project into two sprints: "Minimum Viable Product (MVP)" and "2nd Version" sprint, where MVP had to be completely finished before we developed further in the next sprint. We held daily stand-up meetings and code-review meetings as needed.
Miro was used as an organizational space for our “bigger picture” and Trello was used to structure up tickets and divide the work based on tasks and developmental stages for the project and finally GitHub for version control.

Version 2.0 (What features could be added)
In future iterations of our application, we plan to refine our searchtool to give the users a better control of their search.
We also want to give users the ability to save their favorite recipes and generate shopping lists from those recipes, listing the necessary ingredients and amounts needed to prepare the dish. This will streamline the shopping process, making it easier for users to purchase everything they need for their meals.
Additionally, for more passionate cooks who enjoy building their own virtual recipe book, we will introduce a feature that allows users to easily search and manage their personal recipe database. This virtual recipe book will enable users to quickly find the recipes they need and get started with the main event: cooking!
