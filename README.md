Description of your project

Short description of your project

We are creating an inspirational recipe app that offers a range of options to choose from based on the user's mood, including random recipes, quick recipes, recipes with specific ingredients, or recipes with ingredients already on hand. The app will display recommended dishes on the homepage as small cards with the name of the dish, cooking time, image, and buttons for future use. Clicking on a card will bring up the full recipe with ingredients and instructions. The app also allows the user to select how many results they want to see on their screen (3, 6, or 9).

Short description of your users

Our platform is designed to help people who are seeking cooking inspiration and assistance with meal planning, regardless of their technical knowledge. We understand that not everyone is tech-savvy, which is why our interface is simple and user-friendly.
What kind of problem does the product/service solve, or what value does it add
While there are numerous recipe websites that offer search functionality for specific dishes, it can be challenging to find inspiration for cooking when you don't have a particular recipe in mind. We aim to address this issue by providing a convenient way to discover new recipes through easily customizable filters that allow you to specify the general type of dishes you are interested in.

What techniques have been used

Prisma, NEXT.js, API fetches, server dev, advanced JavaScript, SCSS, UX design, git/GitHub, React, SQL

What project methodology did you use during the project

We followed the Agile methodology for our project, setting our mission, purpose, and "definition of done". The project was divided into two sprints: "Minimum Viable Product (MVP)" and "2nd Version", with MVP completed before moving to the next sprint. Daily stand-up and code-review meetings were held as needed. Miro was used for organization, Trello for structuring tickets and dividing work and GitHub was used for version control.

Version 2.0 (What features could be added)

In future versions of our app, we plan to improve the search tool for better user control.
Users will also be able to save favorite recipes and generate shopping lists with necessary ingredients and amounts. This streamlines the shopping process, simplifying meal preparation. We will also introduce a feature for passionate cooks to search and manage their own recipe database, making it easy to find and use recipes.
We believe these features will help users what they need to get started with the main event: cooking!
