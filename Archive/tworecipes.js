        'Carrots can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. The starch in the carrots will turn to sugar over time, but this is not a problem, they\'ll just taste sweeter. The academy lesson about <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/carrots">carrots</a> contains more useful information.',
        'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.',
